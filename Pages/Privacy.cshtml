            <p>The Policy relates to this website (the “Site”). It is set out to meet the requirements of the UK’s Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Act”) and it relates to the collection, protection, disclosure and use of personal data belonging only to living individuals.</p>

            <p>This Policy, together with our Website Terms and Conditions, sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data. By visiting our website or using any of our services you are accepting and consenting to the practices described here.</p>

            <p>1. Information we may collect from you</p>
            <p>1.1. We may collect and process the following data about you:</p>

            <p>1.1.1. information that you may provide by filling in online forms and registration forms (including registering for products, services or newsletters) on the Site. This includes information provided at the time when you complete an online Application Form on our Site, or request further services. We may also ask you for information in the event you report a problem with our Site;</p>

            <p>1.1.2. correspondence, or a record of it if you should contact us, together with your contact details and our responses;</p>

            <p>1.1.3. surveys that we use for research purposes, which we have asked you to complete, although you do not have to respond to them;</p>

            <p>1.1.4. details of your visit to our Site, and the resources that you access. See also Clause 4.2.</p>

            <p>2. How we use your information</p>
            <p>2.1. We use information held about you in the following ways:</p>

            <p>2.1.1. to process and submit your Application Form to credit brokers and lenders (the “Partners”);</p>

            <p>2.1.2. to provide you with the best possible service;</p>

            <p>2.1.3. to ensure that content from our Site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer; and</p>

            <p>2.1.4. to notify you about changes to our products and services.</p>

            <p>2.2. In addition to the above, we may disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>

            <p>2.2.1. to prepare or send any communications to you, or to assist us in connection with any of our administrative or business functions, or in the provision of any of our services to you;</p>

            <p>2.2.2. if the Company or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us about our customers will be one of the transferred assets;</p>

            <p>2.2.3. if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Website Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Company, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>

            <p>2.3. It is sometimes necessary for the Company to transfer information held about you to lenders and brokers based outside of the European Economic Area. The Eighth Data Protection Principle of the Act restricts the transfer of personal data to a country outside the European Economic Area unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects. By submitting your Application Form you consent to this transfer. You may withdraw your consent at a later date by writing to us at contact@livelyloans.co.uk or livelyloans.co.uk, Bank Chambers, 93 Lapwing Lane, Didsbury, M20 6UR.</p>

            <p>2.4.

This information, and any other general information about our users that we share with advertisers and other partners, will not disclose personal information about you.</p>

            <p>2.7 3rd party marketing: We will gain your express opt-in consent before we send you any information about third party products, services and offers that might be of interest to you.
